Hello! I'm Amanda Shafack

I'm a creative Software Engineer who is highly motivated to deliver exceptional results. I code in Python, C and Dart/Flutter.

Also, I have some experience building tech communities through the Google Developer Group and Women Techmakers program in Buea, Cameroon.

In my spare time, I do a lot of sports, dancing and hiking. I really love outdoor scenes and taking up challenging adventures.
